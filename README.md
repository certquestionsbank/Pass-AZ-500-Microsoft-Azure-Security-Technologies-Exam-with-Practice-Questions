The AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies exam is your gateway to becoming a Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate. As cloud environments become more complex and security threats evolve rapidly, organizations are actively seeking professionals who can secure cloud platforms and respond to threats effectively. The AZ-500 certification validates your ability to implement security controls, manage a security posture, and identify and remediate vulnerabilities in Azure, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.

## Why Earn the AZ-500 Certification?

Azure Security Engineers play a vital role in any cloud-first organization. They are responsible for safeguarding cloud infrastructure by implementing robust security mechanisms, ensuring compliance with industry standards, and collaborating across IT teams to strengthen cloud defense strategies.

By passing the AZ-500 exam, you demonstrate your ability to:

- Manage the security posture of cloud and hybrid environments.
- Implement and monitor threat protection.
- Identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
- Apply regulatory compliance across infrastructure components such as identity, compute, networking, data, and DevOps.

You’ll also be expected to be familiar with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel, and Microsoft Entra ID - the backbone tools for monitoring, governance, and identity protection in Azure.

## What Skills Does AZ-500 Cover?

The exam is structured around four key domains:

**Secure Identity and Access**
Learn to manage identity and access using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), enforce least privilege access, and implement multi-factor authentication and conditional access policies.

**Secure Networking**
Understand how to secure virtual networks, configure Azure Firewall, implement network security groups (NSGs), private endpoints, and secure connectivity across cloud and on-premises environments.

**Secure Compute, Storage, and Databases**
Protect compute resources like VMs and containers, encrypt storage accounts, secure SQL databases, and enforce security policies using Azure Policy and Microsoft Defender.

**Secure Azure Using Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel**
Deploy and configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud to assess and improve security posture, detect threats, and automate responses. Use Microsoft Sentinel for SIEM and SOAR capabilities to centralize and correlate security data.
